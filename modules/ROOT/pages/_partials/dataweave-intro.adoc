DataWeave is the programming language designed by MuleSoft for data transformation, it is also the expression language Mule runtime engine uses to configure components and connectors.

DataWeave enables you to build a simple solution for a common use case for integration developers: read and parse data from one format, transform the data, and write it out as a different format. For example, a DataWeave script can receive a CSV file as input and transform it into an array of complex JSON objects, or receive an XML input and write the data out to a flat file format. DataWeave enables developers to focus on the transformation logic instead of thinking about the specifics of reading, parsing, and writing specific data formats in a performant way.
